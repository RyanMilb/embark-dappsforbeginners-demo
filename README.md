# embark-dappsforbeginners-demo
Port of the [dappsforbeginners](https://dappsforbeginners.wordpress.com) Ethereum decentralized app (DApp) tutorial site to a demo project using the [Embark](https://iurimatias.github.io/embark-framework/) development framework.

## Why?
I wanted to learn to write a DApp and the dappsforbeginners site seemed like the best tutorial option, but I couldn't get it to run in Alethzero on Mac (Yosemite). I really like the Embark development workflow and want to publish my own app soon, so I ported and debugged (I think the dappsforbeginners tutorial is using an outdated Javascript API, but I could be wrong).

## Use
Install Embark following the instructions there. Clone this repo. Run embark and load up `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see it work. I'll leave in the console.log() functions so you can pop open the console and see it in action.
